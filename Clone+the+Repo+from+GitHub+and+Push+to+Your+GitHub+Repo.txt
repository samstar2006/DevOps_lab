****** CLONE THE REPOSITORY FROM GITHUB (FOR PROJECT) ***************************

Please follow the below steps -

1. Create a new folder in your local computer (say for example 'Temp')
2. Right click on the folder and click on "Git Bash Here".
3. Type the below commands (the commands are after $ symbol below)

a)
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in ..

If you have issues, I mean if git is asking to setup information about you then follow;

$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
$ git config --global user.email youremail@domain.com

else skip the above 2 commands and continue ...

b)

$ git clone https://github.com/vinaysdevopslab/MyLab.git
....
....
Resolving deltas: 100% (39/39), done.

c) Now double click and open the folder "Temp" -> Delete the ".git" folder
  -> Double click on "MyLab" folder -> Delete the .git folder

d) Close the GitBash terminal.

e) Now copy "MyLab" folder to drive of your choice. say for example
   C:\ drive so now the location of local repo is C:\MyLab
   *** double check the contents of your folder. It should be;
   C:\MyLab -> src(folder),pom.xml,README.md -> double click on src(folder) -> double click on "main" folder
   -> double click on "webapp" folder -> you should see css(folder),WEB-INF(folder) and index.jsp

f) Delete the Temp folder.
